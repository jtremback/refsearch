#refsearch

This uses lunr to search through the backbone and underscore libs documentation on the frontend.
Type in at least 2 letters of the function name and it will automatically display results.

You need to run this with an http server, or it will not work because of some cross-domain stuff.

I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server).

Do `npm install -g http-server` and then type `http-server` in this folder.
