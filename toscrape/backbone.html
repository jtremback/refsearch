        <p>
      <b>Events</b> is a module that can be mixed in to any object, giving the
      object the ability to bind and trigger custom named events. Events do not
      have to be declared before they are bound, and may take passed arguments.
      For example:
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var object = {};

_.extend(object, Backbone.Events);

object.on("alert", function(msg) {
  alert("Triggered " + msg);
});

object.trigger("alert", "an event");
</pre>

    <p>
      For example, to make a handy event dispatcher that can coordinate events
      among different areas of your application: <tt>var dispatcher = _.clone(Backbone.Events)</tt>
    </p>

    <p id="Events-on">
      <b class="header">on</b><code>object.on(event, callback, [context])</code><span class="alias">Alias: bind</span>
      <br />
      Bind a <b>callback</b> function to an object. The callback will be invoked
      whenever the <b>event</b> is fired.
      If you have a large number of different events on a page, the convention is to use colons to
      namespace them: <tt>"poll:start"</tt>, or <tt>"change:selection"</tt>.
      The event string may also be a space-delimited list of several events...
    </p>

<pre>
book.on("change:title change:author", ...);
</pre>

    <p>
      To supply a <b>context</b> value for <tt>this</tt> when the callback is invoked,
      pass the optional third argument: <tt>model.on('change', this.render, this)</tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      Callbacks bound to the special
      <tt>"all"</tt> event will be triggered when any event occurs, and are passed
      the name of the event as the first argument. For example, to proxy all events
      from one object to another:
    </p>

<pre>
proxy.on("all", function(eventName) {
  object.trigger(eventName);
});
</pre>

    <p>
      All Backbone event methods also support an event map syntax, as an alternative
      to positional arguments:
    </p>

<pre>
book.on({
  "change:title": titleView.update,
  "change:author": authorPane.update,
  "destroy": bookView.remove
});
</pre>

    <p id="Events-off">
      <b class="header">off</b><code>object.off([event], [callback], [context])</code><span class="alias">Alias: unbind</span>
      <br />
      Remove a previously-bound <b>callback</b> function from an object. If no
      <b>context</b> is specified, all of the versions of the callback with
      different contexts will be removed. If no
      callback is specified, all callbacks for the <b>event</b> will be
      removed. If no event is specified, callbacks for <i>all</i> events
      will be removed.
    </p>

<pre>
// Removes just the `onChange` callback.
object.off("change", onChange);

// Removes all "change" callbacks.
object.off("change");

// Removes the `onChange` callback for all events.
object.off(null, onChange);

// Removes all callbacks for `context` for all events.
object.off(null, null, context);

// Removes all callbacks on `object`.
object.off();
</pre>

    <p>
      Note that calling <tt>model.off()</tt>, for example, will indeed remove <i>all</i> events
      on the model &mdash; including events that Backbone uses for internal bookkeeping.
    </p>

    <p id="Events-trigger">
      <b class="header">trigger</b><code>object.trigger(event, [*args])</code>
      <br />
      Trigger callbacks for the given <b>event</b>, or space-delimited list of events.
      Subsequent arguments to <b>trigger</b> will be passed along to the
      event callbacks.
    </p>

    <p id="Events-once">
      <b class="header">once</b><code>object.once(event, callback, [context])</code>
      <br />
      Just like <a href="#Events-on">on</a>, but causes the bound callback to only
      fire once before being removed. Handy for saying "the next time that X happens, do this".
    </p>

    <p id="Events-listenTo">
      <b class="header">listenTo</b><code>object.listenTo(other, event, callback)</code>
      <br />
      Tell an <b>object</b> to listen to a particular event on an <b>other</b> object.
      The advantage of using this form, instead of <tt>other.on(event, callback)</tt>,
      is that <b>listenTo</b> allows the <b>object</b> to keep track of the events,
      and they can be removed all at once later on.
    </p>

<pre>
view.listenTo(model, 'change', view.render);
</pre>

    <p id="Events-stopListening">
      <b class="header">stopListening</b><code>object.stopListening([other], [event], [callback])</code>
      <br />
      Tell an <b>object</b> to stop listening to events. Either call
      <b>stopListening</b> with no arguments to have the <b>object</b> remove
      all of its <a href="#Events-listenTo">registered</a> callbacks ... or be more
      precise by telling it to remove just the events it's listening to on a
      specific object, or a specific event, or just a specific callback.
    </p>

<pre>
view.stopListening();

view.stopListening(model);
</pre>

    <p id="Events-catalog">
      <b class="header">Catalog of Events</b>
      <br />
      Here's the complete list of built-in Backbone events, with arguments.
      You're also free to trigger your own events on Models, Collections and
      Views as you see fit. The <tt>Backbone</tt> object itself mixes in <tt>Events</tt>,
      and can be used to emit any global events that your application needs.
    </p>

    <ul class="small">
      <li><b>"add"</b> (model, collection, options) &mdash; when a model is added to a collection. </li>
      <li><b>"remove"</b> (model, collection, options) &mdash; when a model is removed from a collection. </li>
      <li><b>"reset"</b> (collection, options) &mdash; when the collection's entire contents have been replaced. </li>
      <li><b>"sort"</b> (collection, options) &mdash; when the collection has been re-sorted. </li>
      <li><b>"change"</b> (model, options) &mdash; when a model's attributes have changed. </li>
      <li><b>"change:[attribute]"</b> (model, value, options) &mdash; when a specific attribute has been updated. </li>
      <li><b>"destroy"</b> (model, collection, options) &mdash; when a model is <a href="#Model-destroy">destroyed</a>. </li>
      <li><b>"request"</b> (model, xhr, options) &mdash; when a model (or collection) has started a request to the server. </li>
      <li><b>"sync"</b> (model, resp, options) &mdash; when a model (or collection) has been successfully synced with the server. </li>
      <li><b>"error"</b> (model, xhr, options) &mdash; when a model's <a href="#Model-save">save</a> call fails on the server. </li>
      <li><b>"invalid"</b> (model, error, options) &mdash; when a model's <a href="#Model-validate">validation</a> fails on the client. </li>
      <li><b>"route:[name]"</b> (params) &mdash; Fired by the router when a specific route is matched.</li>
      <li><b>"route"</b> (router, route, params) &mdash; Fired by history (or router) when <i>any</i> route has been matched.</li>
      <li><b>"all"</b> &mdash; this special event fires for <i>any</i> triggered event, passing the event name as the first argument. </li>
    </ul>


    <p id="Model-extend">
      <b class="header">extend</b><code>Backbone.Model.extend(properties, [classProperties])</code>
      <br />
      To create a <b>Model</b> class of your own, you extend <b>Backbone.Model</b>
      and provide instance <b>properties</b>, as well as optional
      <b>classProperties</b> to be attached directly to the constructor function.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>extend</b> correctly sets up the prototype chain, so subclasses created
      with <b>extend</b> can be further extended and subclassed as far as you like.
    </p>

<pre>
var Note = Backbone.Model.extend({

  initialize: function() { ... },

  author: function() { ... },

  coordinates: function() { ... },

  allowedToEdit: function(account) {
    return true;
  }

});

var PrivateNote = Note.extend({

  allowedToEdit: function(account) {
    return account.owns(this);
  }

});
</pre>

    <p class="warning">
        Brief aside on <tt>super</tt>: JavaScript does not provide
        a simple way to call super &mdash; the function of the same name defined
        higher on the prototype chain. If you override a core function like
        <tt>set</tt>, or <tt>save</tt>, and you want to invoke the
        parent object's implementation, you'll have to explicitly call it, along these lines:
    </p>

<pre>
var Note = Backbone.Model.extend({
  set: function(attributes, options) {
    Backbone.Model.prototype.set.apply(this, arguments);
    ...
  }
});
</pre>

    <p id="Model-constructor">
      <b class="header">constructor / initialize</b><code>new Model([attributes], [options])</code>
      <br />
      When creating an instance of a model, you can pass in the initial values
      of the <b>attributes</b>, which will be <a href="#Model-set">set</a> on the
      model. If you define an <b>initialize</b> function, it will be invoked when
      the model is created.
    </p>

<pre>
new Book({
  title: "One Thousand and One Nights",
  author: "Scheherazade"
});
</pre>

    <p>
      In rare cases, if you're looking to get fancy,
      you may want to override <b>constructor</b>, which allows
      you to replace the actual constructor function for your model.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you pass a <tt>{collection: ...}</tt> as the <b>options</b>, the model
      gains a <tt>collection</tt> property that will be used to indicate which
      collection the model belongs to, and is used to help compute the model's
      <a href="#Model-url">url</a>. The <tt>model.collection</tt> property is
      otherwise added automatically when you first add a model to a collection.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-get">
      <b class="header">get</b><code>model.get(attribute)</code>
      <br />
      Get the current value of an attribute from the model. For example:
      <tt>note.get("title")</tt>
    </p>

    <p id="Model-set">
      <b class="header">set</b><code>model.set(attributes, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Set a hash of attributes (one or many) on the model. If any of the attributes
      change the model's state, a <tt>"change"</tt> event will be triggered, unless
      <tt>{silent: true}</tt> is passed as an option. Change events for specific
      attributes are also triggered, and you can bind to those as well, for example:
      <tt>change:title</tt>, and <tt>change:content</tt>. You may also pass
      individual keys and values.
    </p>

<pre>
note.set({title: "March 20", content: "In his eyes she eclipses..."});

book.set("title", "A Scandal in Bohemia");
</pre>

    <p id="Model-escape">
      <b class="header">escape</b><code>model.escape(attribute)</code>
      <br />
      Similar to <a href="#Model-get">get</a>, but returns the HTML-escaped version
      of a model's attribute. If you're interpolating data from the model into
      HTML, using <b>escape</b> to retrieve attributes will prevent
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a> attacks.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var hacker = new Backbone.Model({
  name: "&lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/script&gt;"
});

alert(hacker.escape('name'));
</pre>

    <p id="Model-has">
      <b class="header">has</b><code>model.has(attribute)</code>
      <br />
      Returns <tt>true</tt> if the attribute is set to a non-null or non-undefined
      value.
    </p>

<pre>
if (note.has("title")) {
  ...
}
</pre>

    <p id="Model-unset">
      <b class="header">unset</b><code>model.unset(attribute, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Remove an attribute by deleting it from the internal attributes hash.
      Fires a <tt>"change"</tt> event unless <tt>silent</tt> is passed as an option.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-clear">
      <b class="header">clear</b><code>model.clear([options])</code>
      <br />
      Removes all attributes from the model, including the <tt>id</tt> attribute. Fires a <tt>"change"</tt> event unless
      <tt>silent</tt> is passed as an option.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-id">
      <b class="header">id</b><code>model.id</code>
      <br />
      A special property of models, the <b>id</b> is an arbitrary string
      (integer id or UUID). If you set the <b>id</b> in the
      attributes hash, it will be copied onto the model as a direct property.
      Models can be retrieved by id from collections, and the id is used to generate
      model URLs by default.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-idAttribute">
      <b class="header">idAttribute</b><code>model.idAttribute</code>
      <br />
      A model's unique identifier is stored under the <tt>id</tt> attribute.
      If you're directly communicating with a backend (CouchDB, MongoDB) that uses
      a different unique key, you may set a Model's <tt>idAttribute</tt> to
      transparently map from that key to <tt>id</tt>.

<pre class="runnable">
var Meal = Backbone.Model.extend({
  idAttribute: "_id"
});

var cake = new Meal({ _id: 1, name: "Cake" });
alert("Cake id: " + cake.id);
</pre>
    </p>

    <p id="Model-cid">
      <b class="header">cid</b><code>model.cid</code>
      <br />
      A special property of models, the <b>cid</b> or client id is a unique identifier
      automatically assigned to all models when they're first created. Client ids
      are handy when the model has not yet been saved to the server, and does not
      yet have its eventual true <b>id</b>, but already needs to be visible in the UI.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-attributes">
      <b class="header">attributes</b><code>model.attributes</code>
      <br />
      The <b>attributes</b> property is the internal hash containing the model's
      state &mdash; usually (but not necessarily) a form of the JSON object
      representing the model data on the server. It's often a straightforward
      serialization of a row from the database, but it could also be client-side
      computed state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please use <a href="#Model-set">set</a> to update the <b>attributes</b>
      instead of modifying them directly. If you'd like to retrieve and munge a
      copy of the model's attributes, use <tt>_.clone(model.attributes)</tt>
      instead.
    </p>

    <p class="warning">
      Due to the fact that <a href="#Events">Events</a> accepts space separated
      lists of events, attribute names should not include spaces.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-changed">
      <b class="header">changed</b><code>model.changed</code>
      <br />
      The <b>changed</b> property is the internal hash containing all the attributes
      that have changed since the last <tt>"change"</tt> event was triggered.
      Please do not update <b>changed</b> directly since its state is internally maintained
      by <a href="#Model-set">set</a>.  A copy of <b>changed</b> can be acquired from
      <a href="#Model-changedAttributes">changedAttributes</a>.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-defaults">
      <b class="header">defaults</b><code>model.defaults or model.defaults()</code>
      <br />
      The <b>defaults</b> hash (or function) can be used to specify the default
      attributes for your model. When creating an instance of the model,
      any unspecified attributes will be set to their default value.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var Meal = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    "appetizer":  "caesar salad",
    "entree":     "ravioli",
    "dessert":    "cheesecake"
  }
});

alert("Dessert will be " + (new Meal).get('dessert'));
</pre>

    <p class="warning">
      Remember that in JavaScript, objects are passed by reference, so if you
      include an object as a default value, it will be shared among all instances.
      Instead, define <b>defaults</b> as a function.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-toJSON">
      <b class="header">toJSON</b><code>model.toJSON()</code>
      <br />
      Return a copy of the model's <a href="#Model-attributes">attributes</a>
      for JSON stringification.  This can be used for persistence,
      serialization, or for augmentation before being sent to the server. The
      name of this method is a bit confusing, as it doesn't actually return a
      JSON string &mdash; but I'm afraid that it's the way that the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSON#toJSON()_method">JavaScript API for <b>JSON.stringify</b></a>
      works.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var artist = new Backbone.Model({
  firstName: "Wassily",
  lastName: "Kandinsky"
});

artist.set({birthday: "December 16, 1866"});

alert(JSON.stringify(artist));
</pre>

    <p id="Model-sync">
      <b class="header">sync</b><code>model.sync(method, model, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Uses <a href="#Sync">Backbone.sync</a> to persist the state of a model to
      the server.  Can be overridden for custom behavior.
    </p>

    <p id="Model-fetch">
      <b class="header">fetch</b><code>model.fetch([options])</code>
      <br />
      Resets the model's state from the server by delegating to
      <a href="#Sync">Backbone.sync</a>. Returns a
      <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a>.
      Useful if the model has never
      been populated with data, or if you'd like to ensure that you have the
      latest server state. A <tt>"change"</tt> event will be triggered if the
      server's state differs from the current attributes. Accepts
      <tt>success</tt> and <tt>error</tt> callbacks in the options hash, which
      are passed <tt>(model, response, options)</tt>
      and <tt>(model, xhr, options)</tt> as arguments, respectively.
    </p>

<pre>
// Poll every 10 seconds to keep the channel model up-to-date.
setInterval(function() {
  channel.fetch();
}, 10000);
</pre>

    <p id="Model-save">
      <b class="header">save</b><code>model.save([attributes], [options])</code>
      <br />
      Save a model to your database (or alternative persistence layer),
      by delegating to <a href="#Sync">Backbone.sync</a>.  Returns a
      <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a> if
      validation is successful and <tt>false</tt> otherwise. The <b>attributes</b>
      hash (as in <a href="#Model-set">set</a>) should contain the attributes
      you'd like to change &mdash; keys that aren't mentioned won't be altered &mdash; but,
      a <i>complete representation</i> of the resource will be sent to the server.
      As with <tt>set</tt>, you may pass individual keys and values instead of a hash.
      If the model has a <a href="#Model-validate">validate</a>
      method, and validation fails, the model will not be saved. If the model
      <a href="#Model-isNew">isNew</a>, the save will be a <tt>"create"</tt>
      (HTTP <tt>POST</tt>), if the model already
      exists on the server, the save will be an <tt>"update"</tt> (HTTP <tt>PUT</tt>).
    </p>

    <p>
      If instead, you'd only like the <i>changed</i> attributes to be sent to the
      server, call <tt>model.save(attrs, {patch: true})</tt>. You'll get an HTTP
      <tt>PATCH</tt> request to the server with just the passed-in attributes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Calling <tt>save</tt> with new attributes will cause a <tt>"change"</tt>
      event immediately, a <tt>"request"</tt> event as the Ajax request begins to
      go to the server, and a <tt>"sync"</tt> event after the server has acknowledged
      the successful change. Pass <tt>{wait: true}</tt> if you'd like to wait
      for the server before setting the new attributes on the model.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following example, notice how our overridden version
      of <tt>Backbone.sync</tt> receives a <tt>"create"</tt> request
      the first time the model is saved and an <tt>"update"</tt>
      request the second time.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">

      as arguments, respectively.
      Triggers a <tt>"destroy"</tt> event on the model, which will bubble up
      through any collections that contain it, a <tt>"request"</tt> event as it
      begins the Ajax request to the server, and a <tt>"sync"</tt> event, after
      the server has successfully acknowledged the model's deletion. Pass
      <tt>{wait: true}</tt> if you'd like to wait for the server to respond

    <p id="Model-validate">
      <b class="header">validate</b><code>model.validate(attributes, options)</code>
      <br />
      This method is left undefined, and you're encouraged to override it with
      your custom validation logic, if you have any that can be performed
      in JavaScript. By default <b>validate</b> is called before
      <tt>save</tt>, but can also be called before <tt>set</tt> if
      <tt>{validate:true}</tt> is passed. The <b>validate</b> method is passed
      the model attributes, as well as the options from <tt>set</tt> or <tt>save</tt>.
      If the attributes are valid, don't return anything from <b>validate</b>;
      if they are invalid, return an error of your choosing. It
      can be as simple as a string error message to be displayed, or a complete
      error object that describes the error programmatically. If <b>validate</b>

      Returns the relative URL where the model's resource would be located on
      the server. If your models are located somewhere else, override this method
      with the correct logic. Generates URLs of the form: <tt>"[collection.url]/[id]"</tt>
      by default, but you may override by specifying an explicit <tt>urlRoot</tt>
      if the model's collection shouldn't be taken into account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Delegates to <a href="#Collection-url">Collection#url</a> to generate the
      URL, so make sure that you have it defined, or a <a href="#Model-urlRoot">urlRoot</a>
      property, if all models of this class share a common root URL.

    <p id="Model-urlRoot">
      <b class="header">urlRoot</b><code>model.urlRoot or model.urlRoot()</code>

      Specify a <tt>urlRoot</tt> if you're using a model <i>outside</i> of a collection,
      to enable the default <a href="#Model-url">url</a> function to generate
      URLs based on the model id. <tt>"[urlRoot]/id"</tt><br />
      Normally, you won't need to define this.

      If you're working with a Rails backend that has a version prior to 3.1,

      the attributes in that hash which differ from the model. This can be used
      to figure out which portions of a view should be updated, or what calls

    <p>
      Collections are ordered sets of models. You can bind <tt>"change"</tt> events
      to be notified when any model in the collection has been modified,
      listen for <tt>"add"</tt> and <tt>"remove"</tt> events, <tt>fetch</tt>
      the collection from the server, and use a full suite of
      <a href="#Collection-Underscore-Methods">Underscore.js methods</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any event that is triggered on a model in a collection will also be
      triggered on the collection directly, for convenience.
      This allows you to listen for changes to specific attributes in any
      model in a collection, for example:
      <tt>Documents.on("change:selected", ...)</tt>
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-extend">
      <b class="header">extend</b><code>Backbone.Collection.extend(properties, [classProperties])</code>
      <br />
      To create a <b>Collection</b> class of your own, extend <b>Backbone.Collection</b>,
      providing instance <b>properties</b>, as well as optional <b>classProperties</b> to be attached
      directly to the collection's constructor function.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-model">
      <b class="header">model</b><code>collection.model</code>
      <br />
      Override this property to specify the model class that the collection
      contains. If defined, you can pass raw attributes objects (and arrays) to
      <a href="#Collection-add">add</a>, <a href="#Collection-create">create</a>,
      and <a href="#Collection-reset">reset</a>, and the attributes will be
      converted into a model of the proper type.

<pre>
var Library = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Book
});
</pre>

    <p id="Collection-constructor">
      <b class="header">constructor / initialize</b><code>new Collection([models], [options])</code>
      <br />
      When creating a Collection, you may choose to pass in the initial array
      of <b>models</b>.  The collection's <a href="#Collection-comparator">comparator</a>
      may be included as an option. Passing <tt>false</tt> as the
      comparator option will prevent sorting. If you define an
      <b>initialize</b> function, it will be invoked when the collection is
      created.
    </p>

</pre>

    <p id="Collection-models">
      <b class="header">models</b><code>collection.models</code>
      <br />
      Raw access to the JavaScript array of models inside of the collection. Usually you'll
      want to use <tt>get</tt>, <tt>at</tt>, or the <b>Underscore methods</b>
      to access model objects, but occasionally a direct reference to the array
      is desired.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-toJSON">
      <b class="header">toJSON</b><code>collection.toJSON()</code>
      <br />
      Return an array containing the attributes hash of each model in the
      collection. This can be used to serialize and persist the
      collection as a whole. The name of this method is a bit confusing, because
      it conforms to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSON#toJSON()_method">JavaScript's JSON API</a>.
    </p>

      Add a model (or an array of models) to the collection. Fires an <tt>"add"</tt>
      event, which you can pass <tt>{silent: true}</tt> to suppress. If a
      <a href="#Collection-model">model</a> property is defined, you may also pass

    <p id="Collection-remove">
      <b class="header">remove</b><code>collection.remove(models, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Remove a model (or an array of models) from the collection. Fires a
      <tt>"remove"</tt> event, which you can use <tt>silent</tt> to suppress.
      The model's index before removal is available to listeners as
      <tt>options.index</tt>.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-reset">
      <b class="header">reset</b><code>collection.reset([models], [options])</code>
      <br />
      Adding and removing models one at a time is all well and good, but sometimes
      you have so many models to change that you'd rather just update the collection
      in bulk. Use <b>reset</b> to replace a collection with a new list
      of models (or attribute hashes), triggering a single <tt>"reset"</tt> event
      at the end. Pass <tt>{silent: true}</tt> to suppress the <tt>"reset"</tt> event.
      For convenience, within a <tt>"reset"</tt> event, the list of any previous
      models is available as <tt>options.previousModels</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's an example using <b>reset</b> to bootstrap a collection during initial page load,
      in a Rails application:
    </p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
  var accounts = new Backbone.Collection;
  accounts.reset(&lt;%= @accounts.to_json %&gt;);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    <p>
      Calling <tt>collection.reset()</tt> without passing any models as arguments
      will empty the entire collection.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-update">
      <b class="header">update</b><code>collection.update(models, [options])</code>
      <br />
      The <b>update</b> method tries to peform a "smart" update of the collection
      with the passed list of models. If a model in the list isn't yet in the
      collection it will be added; if the model is already in the collection
      its attributes will be merged; and if the collection contains any models that
      <i>aren't</i> present in the list, they'll be removed. All of the appropriate
      <tt>"add"</tt>, <tt>"remove"</tt>, and <tt>"change"</tt> events are fired
      as this happens. If you'd like to customize the behavior, you can disable
      it with options: <tt>{add: false}</tt>, <tt>{remove: false}</tt>, or <tt>{merge: false}</tt>.
    </p>

<pre>
var vanHalen = new Collection([eddie, alex, stone, roth]);

vanHalen.update([eddie, alex, stone, hagar]);

// Fires a "remove" event for roth, and an "add" event for "hagar".
// Updates any of stone, alex, and eddie's attributes that may have
// changed over the years.
</pre>

    <p id="Collection-get">

var book = Library.get(110);
</pre>

    <p id="Collection-at">
      <b class="header">at</b><code>collection.at(index)</code>
      <br />
      Get a model from a collection, specified by index. Useful if your collection
      is sorted, and if your collection isn't sorted, <b>at</b> will still
      retrieve models in insertion order.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-push">
      <b class="header">push</b><code>collection.push(model, [options])</code>
      <br />

    <p id="Collection-pop">

    </p>

    <p id="Collection-shift">
      <b class="header">shift</b><code>collection.shift([options])</code>

    </p>

    <p id="Collection-slice">

    </p>

    <p id="Collection-length">
      <b class="header">length</b><code>collection.length</code>
      <br />
      Like an array, a Collection maintains a <tt>length</tt> property, counting
      the number of models it contains.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-comparator">
      <b class="header">comparator</b><code>collection.comparator</code>
      <br />
      By default there is no <b>comparator</b> for a collection.
      If you define a comparator, it will be used to maintain
      the collection in sorted order. This means that as models are added,
      they are inserted at the correct index in <tt>collection.models</tt>.
      A comparator can be defined as a
      <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#sortBy">sortBy</a>
      (pass a function that takes a single argument),
      as a
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">sort</a>
      (pass a comparator function that expects two arguments),
      or as a string indicating the attribute to sort by.
    </p>

    <p>
      "sortBy" comparator functions take a model and return a numeric or string
      value by which the model should be ordered relative to others.
      "sort" comparator functions take two models, and return <tt>-1</tt> if
      the first model should come before the second, <tt>0</tt> if they are of
      the same rank and <tt>1</tt> if the first model should come after.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note how even though all of the chapters in this example are added backwards,
      they come out in the proper order:
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var Chapter  = Backbone.Model;

chapters.add(new Chapter({page: 1, title: "The Beginning"}));

</pre>

    <p class="warning">
      Collections with a comparator will not automatically re-sort if you

      <tt>sort</tt> after changing model attributes that would affect the order.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-sort">
      <b class="header">sort</b><code>collection.sort([options])</code>
      <br />
      Force a collection to re-sort itself. You don't need to call this under
      normal circumstances, as a collection with a <a href="#Collection-comparator">comparator</a>
      will sort itself whenever a model is added. To disable sorting when adding
      a model, pass <tt>{sort: false}</tt> to <tt>add</tt>. Calling <b>sort</b>
      triggers a <tt>"sort"</tt> event on the collection, unless silenced by
      passing

    <p id="Collection-pluck">
      <b class="header">pluck</b><code>collection.pluck(attribute)</code>

  url: '/notes'
});

// Or, something more sophisticated:

var Notes = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  url: function() {
    return this.document.url() + '/notes';
  }
});
</pre>

    <p id="Collection-parse">
      <b class="header">parse</b><code>collection.parse(response, options)</code>
      <br />
      <b>parse</b> is called by Backbone whenever a collection's models are
      returned by the server, in <a href="#Collection-fetch">fetch</a>.
      The function is passed the raw <tt>response</tt> object, and should return
      the array of model attributes to be <a href="#Collection-add">added</a>
      to the collection. The default implementation is a no-op, simply passing
      through the JSON response. Override this if you need to work with a
      preexisting API, or better namespace your responses.
    </p>

<pre>
var Tweets = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  // The Twitter Search API returns tweets under "results".
  parse: function(response) {
    return response.results;
  }
});
</pre>

    <p id="Collection-clone">
      <b class="header">clone</b><code>collection.clone()</code>
      <br />
      Returns a new instance of the collection with an identical list of models.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-fetch">
      <b class="header">fetch</b><code>collection.fetch([options])</code>
      <br />
      Fetch the default set of models for this collection from the server,
      resetting the collection when they arrive. The <b>options</b> hash takes
      <tt>success</tt> and <tt>error</tt>
      callbacks which will be passed <tt>(collection, response, options)</tt>
      and <tt>(collection, xhr, options)</tt> as arguments, respectively.
      When the model data returns from the server, the collection will be (efficiently)
      <a href="#Collection-reset">reset</a>, unless you pass <tt>{update: true}</tt>,
      in which case it will use <a href="#Collection-update">update</a> to (intelligently)
      merge the fetched models.
      Delegates to <a href="#Sync">Backbone.sync</a>
      under the covers for custom persistence strategies and returns a
      <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a>.
      The server handler for <b>fetch</b> requests should return a JSON array of
      models.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
Backbone.sync = function(method, model) {
  alert(method + ": " + model.url);
};

var accounts = new Backbone.Collection;
accounts.url = '/accounts';

accounts.fetch();
</pre>

    <p>
      The behavior of <b>fetch</b> can be customized by using the available
      <a href="#Collection-update">update</a> options. For example, to fetch a
      collection, getting an <tt>"add"</tt> event for every new model, and
      a <tt>"change"</tt> event for every changed existing model, without
      removing anything: <tt>collection.fetch({update: true, remove: false})</tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>jQuery.ajax</b> options can also be passed directly as <b>fetch</b> options,
      so to fetch a specific page of a paginated collection:
      <tt>Documents.fetch({data: {page: 3}})</tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that <b>fetch</b> should not be used to populate collections on
      page load &mdash; all models needed at load time should already be
      <a href="#FAQ-bootstrap">bootstrapped</a> in to place. <b>fetch</b> is
      intended for lazily-loading models for interfaces that are not needed
      immediately: for example, documents with collections of notes that may be
      toggled open and closed.
    </p>

    <p id="Collection-create">
      <b class="header">create</b><code>collection.create(attributes, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Convenience to create a new instance of a model within a collection.
      Equivalent to instantiating a model with a hash of attributes,
      saving the model to the server, and adding the model to the set after being
      successfully created. Returns
      the model, or <tt>false</tt> if a validation error prevented the
      model from being created. In order for this to work, you should set the
      <a href="#Collection-model">model</a> property of the collection.
      The <b>create</b> method can accept either an attributes hash or an
      existing, unsaved model object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a model will cause an immediate <tt>"add"</tt> event to be
      triggered on the collection, a <tt>"request"</tt> event as the new model is
      sent to the server, as well as a <tt>"sync"</tt> event, once the
      server has responded with the successful creation of the model. Pass <tt>{wait: true}</tt>
      if you'd like to wait for the server before adding the new model to the collection.
    </p>

<pre>
var Library = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Book
});

var nypl = new Library;

var othello = nypl.create({
  title: "Othello",
  author: "William Shakespeare"
});
</pre>

    <p>
      Web applications often provide linkable, bookmarkable, shareable URLs for
      important locations in the app. Until recently, hash fragments
      (<tt>#page</tt>) were used to provide these permalinks, but with the
      arrival of the History API, it's now possible to use standard URLs (<tt>/page</tt>).
      <b>Backbone.Router</b> provides methods for routing client-side pages, and
      connecting them to actions and events. For browsers which don't yet support
      the History API, the Router handles graceful fallback and transparent
      translation to the fragment version of the URL.
    </p>

    <p>
      During page load, after your application has finished creating all of its routers,
      be sure to call <tt>Backbone.history.start()</tt>, or
      <tt>Backbone.history.start({pushState: true})</tt> to route the initial URL.
    </p>

    <p id="Router-extend">
      <b class="header">extend</b><code>Backbone.Router.extend(properties, [classProperties])</code>
      <br />
      Get started by creating a custom router class. Define actions that are
      triggered when certain URL fragments are
      matched, and provide a <a href="#Router-routes">routes</a> hash
      that pairs routes to actions. Note that you'll want to avoid using a
      leading slash in your route definitions:
    </p>

<pre>
var Workspace = Backbone.Router.extend({

  routes: {
    "help":                 "help",    // #help
    "search/:query":        "search",  // #search/kiwis
    "search/:query/p:page": "search"   // #search/kiwis/p7
  },

  help: function() {
    ...
  },

  search: function(query, page) {
    ...
  }

});
</pre>

    <p id="Router-routes">
      <b class="header">routes</b><code>router.routes</code>
      <br />
      The routes hash maps URLs with parameters to functions on your router,
      similar to the <a href="#View">View</a>'s <a href="#View-delegateEvents">events hash</a>.
      Routes can contain parameter parts, <tt>:param</tt>, which match a single URL
      component between slashes; and splat parts <tt>*splat</tt>, which can match
      any number of URL components. Part of a route can be made optional by
      surrounding it in parentheses <tt>(/:optional)</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a route of <tt>"search/:query/p:page"</tt> will match
      a fragment of <tt>#search/obama/p2</tt>, passing <tt>"obama"</tt>
      and <tt>"2"</tt> to the action.
    </p>

    <p>
      A route of <tt>"file/*path"</tt> will match
      <tt>#file/nested/folder/file.txt</tt>, passing
      <tt>"nested/folder/file.txt"</tt> to the action.
    </p>

    <p>
      A route of <tt>"docs/:section(/:subsection)"</tt> will match
      <tt>#docs/faq</tt> and <tt>#docs/faq/installing</tt>, passing
      <tt>"faq"</tt> to the action in the first case, and passing <tt>"faq"</tt>
      and <tt>"installing"</tt> to the action in the second.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the visitor presses the back button, or enters a URL, and a particular
      route is matched, the name of the action will be fired as an
      <a href="#Events">event</a>, so that other objects can listen to the router,
      and be notified. In the following example, visiting <tt>#help/uploading</tt>
      will fire a <tt>route:help</tt> event from the router.
    </p>

<pre>
routes: {
  "help/:page":         "help",
  "download/*path":     "download",
  "folder/:name":       "openFolder",
  "folder/:name-:mode": "openFolder"
}
</pre>

<pre>
router.on("route:help", function(page) {
  ...
});
</pre>

    <p id="Router-constructor">
      <b class="header">constructor / initialize</b><code>new Router([options])</code>
      <br />
      When creating a new router, you may pass its
      <a href="#Router-routes">routes</a> hash directly as an option, if you
      choose. All <tt>options</tt> will also be passed to your <tt>initialize</tt>
      function, if defined.
    </p>

    <p id="Router-route">
      <b class="header">route</b><code>router.route(route, name, [callback])</code>
      <br />
      Manually create a route for the router, The <tt>route</tt> argument may
      be a <a href="#Router-routes">routing string</a> or regular expression.
      Each matching capture from the route or regular expression will be passed as
      an argument to the callback. The <tt>name</tt> argument will be triggered as
      a <tt>"route:name"</tt> event whenever the route is matched.  If the
      <tt>callback</tt> argument is omitted <tt>router[name]</tt> will be used
      instead.
    </p>

<pre>
initialize: function(options) {

  // Matches #page/10, passing "10"
  this.route("page/:number", "page", function(number){ ... });

  // Matches /117-a/b/c/open, passing "117-a/b/c" to this.open
  this.route(/^(.*?)\/open$/, "open");

open: function(id) { ... }
</pre>

    <p id="Router-navigate">
      <b class="header">navigate</b><code>router.navigate(fragment, [options])</code>
      <br />
      Whenever you reach a point in your application that you'd like to save
      as a URL, call <b>navigate</b> in order to update the URL.
      If you wish to also call the route function, set the <b>trigger</b>
      option to <tt>true</tt>.
      To update the URL without creating an entry in the browser's history,
      set the <b>replace</b> option to <tt>true</tt>.

<pre>
openPage: function(pageNumber) {
  this.document.pages.at(pageNumber).open();
  this.navigate("page/" + pageNumber);

app.navigate("help/troubleshooting", {trigger: true});

# Or ...

app.navigate("help/troubleshooting", {trigger: true, replace: true});
</pre>

    <p>
      <b>History</b> serves as a global router (per frame) to handle <tt>hashchange</tt>
      events or <tt>pushState</tt>, match the appropriate route, and trigger callbacks. You shouldn't
      ever have to create one of these yourself &mdash; you should use the reference
      to <tt>Backbone.history</tt> that will be created for you automatically if you make use
      of <a href="#Router">Routers</a> with <a href="#Router-routes">routes</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>pushState</b> support exists on a purely opt-in basis in Backbone.
      Older browsers that don't support <tt>pushState</tt> will continue to use
      hash-based URL fragments, and if a hash URL is visited by a
      <tt>pushState</tt>-capable browser, it will be transparently upgraded to
      the true URL. Note that using real URLs requires your web server to be
      able to correctly render those pages, so back-end changes are required
      as well. For example, if you have a route of <tt>/documents/100</tt>,
      your web server must be able to serve that page, if the browser
      visits that URL directly. For full search-engine crawlability, it's best to
      have the server generate the complete HTML for the page ... but if it's a web
      application, just rendering the same content you would have for the root URL,
      and filling in the rest with Backbone Views and JavaScript works fine.
    </p>

    <p id="History-start">
      <b class="header">start</b><code>Backbone.history.start([options])</code>
      <br />
      When all of your <a href="#Router">Routers</a> have been created,
      and all of the routes are set up properly, call <tt>Backbone.history.start()</tt>
      to begin monitoring <tt>hashchange</tt> events, and dispatching routes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To indicate that you'd like to use HTML5 <tt>pushState</tt> support in
      your application, use <tt>Backbone.history.start({pushState: true})</tt>.
      If you'd like to use <tt>pushState</tt>, but have browsers that don't support
      it natively use full page refreshes instead, you can add
      <tt>{hashChange: false}</tt> to the options.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your application is not being served from the root url <tt>/</tt> of your
      domain, be sure to tell History where the root really is, as an option:
      <tt>Backbone.history.start({pushState: true, root: "/public/search/"})</tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      When called, if a route succeeds with a match for the current URL,
      <tt>Backbone.history.start()</tt> returns <tt>true</tt>. If no defined
      route matches the current URL, it returns <tt>false</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the server has already rendered the entire page, and you don't want the
      initial route to trigger when starting History, pass <tt>silent: true</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because hash-based history in Internet Explorer relies on an
      <tt>&lt;iframe&gt;</tt>, be sure to only call <tt>start()</tt> after the DOM
      is ready.
    </p>

<pre>
$(function(){
  new WorkspaceRouter();
  new HelpPaneRouter();
  Backbone.history.start({pushState: true});
});
</pre>

    <p>
      <b>Backbone.sync</b> is the function that Backbone calls every time it
      attempts to read or save a model to the server. By default, it uses
      <tt>(jQuery/Zepto).ajax</tt> to make a RESTful JSON request and returns a
      <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR</a>. You can override
      it in order to use a different persistence strategy, such as WebSockets,
      XML transport, or Local Storage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method signature of <b>Backbone.sync</b> is <tt>sync(method, model, [options])</tt>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>method</b> – the CRUD method (<tt>"create"</tt>, <tt>"read"</tt>, <tt>"update"</tt>, or <tt>"delete"</tt>)</li>
      <li><b>model</b> – the model to be saved (or collection to be read)</li>
      <li><b>options</b> – success and error callbacks, and all other jQuery request options</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With the default implementation, when <b>Backbone.sync</b> sends up a request to save
      a model, its attributes will be passed, serialized as JSON, and sent in the HTTP body
      with content-type <tt>application/json</tt>. When returning a JSON response,
      send down the attributes of the  model that have been changed by the server, and need
      to be updated on the client. When responding to a <tt>"read"</tt> request from a collection
      (<a href="#Collection#fetch">Collection#fetch</a>), send down an array
      of model attribute objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever a model or collection begins a <b>sync</b> with the server, a
      <tt>"request"</tt> event is emitted. If the request completes successfully
      you'll get a <tt>"sync"</tt> event, and an <tt>"error"</tt> event if not.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>sync</b> function may be overriden globally as <tt>Backbone.sync</tt>,
      or at a finer-grained level, by adding a <tt>sync</tt> function to a Backbone
      collection or to an individual model.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default <b>sync</b> handler maps CRUD to REST like so:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>create &rarr; POST &nbsp; </b><tt>/collection</tt></li>
      <li><b>read &rarr; GET &nbsp; </b><tt>/collection[/id]</tt></li>
      <li><b>update &rarr; PUT &nbsp; </b><tt>/collection/id</tt></li>
      <li><b>delete &rarr; DELETE &nbsp; </b><tt>/collection/id</tt></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As an example, a Rails handler responding to an <tt>"update"</tt> call from
      <tt>Backbone</tt> might look like this: <i>(In real code, never use
      </i><tt>update_attributes</tt><i> blindly, and always whitelist the attributes
      you allow to be changed.)</i>
    </p>

<pre>
def update
  account = Account.find params[:id]
  account.update_attributes params
  render :json => account
end
</pre>

    <p>
      One more tip for integrating Rails versions prior to 3.1 is to disable
      the default namespacing for <tt>to_json</tt> calls on models by setting
      <tt>ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = false</tt>
    </p>

    <p id="Sync-ajax">
      <b class="header">ajax</b><code>Backbone.ajax = function(request) { ... };</code>
      <br />
      If you want to use a custom AJAX function, or your endpoint doesn't support
      the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/">jQuery.ajax</a> API
      and you need to tweak things, you can do so by setting <tt>Backbone.ajax</tt>.
    </p>

    <p id="Sync-emulateHTTP">
      <b class="header">emulateHTTP</b><code>Backbone.emulateHTTP = true</code>
      <br />
      If you want to work with a legacy web server that doesn't support Backbone's
      default REST/HTTP approach, you may choose to turn on <tt>Backbone.emulateHTTP</tt>.
      Setting this option will fake <tt>PUT</tt> and <tt>DELETE</tt> requests with
      a HTTP <tt>POST</tt>, setting the <tt>X-HTTP-Method-Override</tt> header
      with the true method. If <tt>emulateJSON</tt> is also on, the true method
      will be passed as an additional <tt>_method</tt> parameter.
    </p>

<pre>
Backbone.emulateHTTP = true;

model.save();  // POST to "/collection/id", with "_method=PUT" + header.
</pre>

    <p id="Sync-emulateJSON">
      <b class="header">emulateJSON</b><code>Backbone.emulateJSON = true</code>
      <br />
      If you're working with a legacy web server that can't handle requests
      encoded as <tt>application/json</tt>, setting <tt>Backbone.emulateJSON = true;</tt>
      will cause the JSON to be serialized under a <tt>model</tt> parameter, and
      the request to be made with a <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt>
      mime type, as if from an HTML form.
    </p>


    <p>
      Backbone views are almost more convention than they are code &mdash; they
      don't determine anything about your HTML or CSS for you, and can be used
      with any JavaScript templating library.
      The general idea is to organize your interface into logical views,
      backed by models, each of which can be updated independently when the
      model changes, without having to redraw the page. Instead of digging into
      a JSON object, looking up an element in the DOM, and updating the HTML by hand,
      you can bind your view's <tt>render</tt> function to the model's <tt>"change"</tt>
      event &mdash; and now everywhere that
      model data is displayed in the UI, it is always immediately up to date.
    </p>

    <p id="View-extend">
      <b class="header">extend</b><code>Backbone.View.extend(properties, [classProperties])</code>
      <br />
      Get started with views by creating a custom view class. You'll want to
      override the <a href="#View-render">render</a> function, specify your
      declarative <a href="#View-delegateEvents">events</a>, and perhaps the
      <tt>tagName</tt>, <tt>className</tt>, or <tt>id</tt> of the View's root
      element.
    </p>

<pre>
var DocumentRow = Backbone.View.extend({

  tagName: "li",

  className: "document-row",

  events: {
    "click .icon":          "open",
    "click .button.edit":   "openEditDialog",
    "click .button.delete": "destroy"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    this.listenTo(this.model, "change", this.render);
  }

  render: function() {
    ...
  }

});
</pre>

    <p>
      Properties like <tt>tagName</tt>, <tt>id</tt>, <tt>className</tt>,
      <tt>el</tt>, and <tt>events</tt> may also be defined as a function, if
      you want to wait to define them until runtime.
    </p>

    <p id="View-constructor">
      <b class="header">constructor / initialize</b><code>new View([options])</code>
      <br />
      When creating a new View, the options you pass &mdash; after being merged
      into any default options already present on the view &mdash;
      are attached to the view as <tt>this.options</tt> for future reference.
      There are several special
      options that, if passed, will be attached directly to the view:
      <tt>model</tt>, <tt>collection</tt>,
      <tt>el</tt>, <tt>id</tt>, <tt>className</tt>, <tt>tagName</tt> and <tt>attributes</tt>.
      If the view defines an <b>initialize</b> function, it will be called when
      the view is first created. If you'd like to create a view that references
      an element <i>already</i> in the DOM, pass in the element as an option:
      <tt>new View({el: existingElement})</tt>
    </p>

<pre>
var doc = Documents.first();

new DocumentRow({
  model: doc,
  id: "document-row-" + doc.id
});
</pre>

    <p id="View-el">
      <b class="header">el</b><code>view.el</code>
      <br />
      All views have a DOM element at all times (the <b>el</b> property),
      whether they've already been inserted into the page or not. In this
      fashion, views can be rendered at any time, and inserted into the DOM all
      at once, in order to get high-performance UI rendering with as few
      reflows and repaints as possible. <tt>this.el</tt> is created from the
      view's <tt>tagName</tt>, <tt>className</tt>, <tt>id</tt> and <tt>attributes</tt> properties,
      if specified. If not, <b>el</b> is an empty <tt>div</tt>.
    </p>

<pre class="runnable">
var ItemView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: 'li'
});

var BodyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: 'body'
});

var item = new ItemView();
var body = new BodyView();

alert(item.el + ' ' + body.el);
</pre>

    <p id="View-$el">
      <b class="header">$el</b><code>view.$el</code>
      <br />
      A cached jQuery (or Zepto) object for the view's element. A handy
      reference instead of re-wrapping the DOM element all the time.
    </p>

<pre>
view.$el.show();

listView.$el.append(itemView.el);
</pre>

    <p id="View-setElement">
      <b class="header">setElement</b><code>view.setElement(element)</code>
      <br />
      If you'd like to apply a Backbone view to a different DOM element, use
      <b>setElement</b>, which will also create the cached <tt>$el</tt> reference
      and move the view's delegated events from the old element to the new one.
    </p>

    <p id="View-attributes">
      <b class="header">attributes</b><code>view.attributes</code>
      <br />
      A hash of attributes that will be set as HTML DOM element attributes on the
      view's <tt>el</tt> (id, class, data-properties, etc.), or a function that
      returns such a hash.
    </p>

    <p id="View-dollar">
      <b class="header">$ (jQuery or Zepto)</b><code>view.$(selector)</code>
      <br />
      If jQuery or Zepto is included on the page, each view has a
      <b>$</b> function that runs queries scoped within the view's element. If you use this
      scoped jQuery function, you don't have to use model ids as part of your query
      to pull out specific elements in a list, and can rely much more on HTML class
      attributes. It's equivalent to running: <tt>view.$el.find(selector)</tt>
    </p>

<pre>
ui.Chapter = Backbone.View.extend({
  serialize : function() {
    return {
      title: this.$(".title").text(),
      start: this.$(".start-page").text(),
      end:   this.$(".end-page").text()
    };
  }
});
</pre>

    <p id="View-render">
      <b class="header">render</b><code>view.render()</code>
      <br />
      The default implementation of <b>render</b> is a no-op. Override this
      function with your code that renders the view template from model data,
      and updates <tt>this.el</tt> with the new HTML. A good
      convention is to <tt>return this</tt> at the end of <b>render</b> to
      enable chained calls.
    </p>

<pre>
var Bookmark = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: _.template(…),
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.attributes));
    return this;
  }
});
</pre>

    <p>
      Backbone is agnostic with respect to your preferred method of HTML templating.
      Your <b>render</b> function could even munge together an HTML string, or use
      <tt>document.createElement</tt> to generate a DOM tree. However, we suggest
      choosing a nice JavaScript templating library.
      <a href="http://github.com/janl/mustache.js">Mustache.js</a>,
      <a href="http://github.com/creationix/haml-js">Haml-js</a>, and
      <a href="http://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</a> are all fine alternatives.
      Because <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> is already on the page,
      <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">_.template</a>
      is available, and is an excellent choice if you prefer simple
      interpolated-JavaScript style templates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever templating strategy you end up with, it's nice if you <i>never</i>
      have to put strings of HTML in your JavaScript. At DocumentCloud, we
      use <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">Jammit</a> in order
      to package up JavaScript templates stored in <tt>/app/views</tt> as part
      of our main <tt>core.js</tt> asset package.

    <p id="View-remove">
      <b class="header">remove</b><code>view.remove()</code>
      <br />
      Removes a view from the DOM, and calls
      <a href="#Events-stopListening">stopListening</a> to remove any bound
      events that the view has <a href="#Events-listenTo">listenTo</a>'d.
    </p>

    <p id="View-delegateEvents">
      <b class="header">delegateEvents</b><code>delegateEvents([events])</code>
      <br />
      Uses jQuery's <tt>on</tt> function to provide declarative callbacks
      for DOM events within a view.
      If an <b>events</b> hash is not passed directly, uses <tt>this.events</tt>
      as the source. Events are written in the format <tt>{"event selector": "callback"}</tt>.
      The callback may be either the name of a method on the view, or a direct
      function body.
      Omitting the <tt>selector</tt> causes the event to be bound to the view's
      root element (<tt>this.el</tt>). By default, <tt>delegateEvents</tt> is called
      within the View's constructor for you, so if you have a simple <tt>events</tt>
      hash, all of your DOM events will always already be connected, and you will
      never have to call this function yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <tt>events</tt> property may also be defined as a function that returns
      an <b>events</b> hash, to make it easier to programmatically define your
      events, as well as inherit them from parent views.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using <b>delegateEvents</b> provides a number of advantages over manually
      using jQuery to bind events to child elements during <a href="#View-render">render</a>. All attached
      callbacks are bound to the view before being handed off to jQuery, so when
      the callbacks are invoked, <tt>this</tt> continues to refer to the view object. When
      <b>delegateEvents</b> is run again, perhaps with a different <tt>events</tt>
      hash, all callbacks are removed and delegated afresh &mdash; useful for
      views which need to behave differently when in different modes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A view that displays a document in a search result might look
      something like this:
    </p>

<pre>
var DocumentView = Backbone.View.extend({

  events: {
    "dblclick"                : "open",
    "click .icon.doc"         : "select",
    "contextmenu .icon.doc"   : "showMenu",
    "click .show_notes"       : "toggleNotes",
    "click .title .lock"      : "editAccessLevel",
    "mouseover .title .date"  : "showTooltip"
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template(this.model.attributes));
    return this;
  },

  open: function() {
    window.open(this.model.get("viewer_url"));
  },

  select: function() {
    this.model.set({selected: true});
  },

  ...

});
</pre>

    <p id="View-undelegateEvents">
      <b class="header">undelegateEvents</b><code>undelegateEvents()</code>
      <br />
      Removes all of the view's delegated events. Useful if you want to disable
      or remove a view from the DOM temporarily.
    </p>

    <p id="Utility-Backbone-noConflict">
      <b class="header">Backbone.noConflict</b><code>var backbone = Backbone.noConflict();</code>
      <br />
      Returns the <tt>Backbone</tt> object back to its original value. You can
      use the return value of <tt>Backbone.noConflict()</tt> to keep a local
      reference to Backbone. Useful for embedding Backbone on third-party
      websites, where you don't want to clobber the existing Backbone.
    </p>

<pre>
var localBackbone = Backbone.noConflict();
var model = localBackbone.Model.extend(...);
</pre>

    <p id="Utility-Backbone-$">
      <b class="header">Backbone.$</b><code>Backbone.$ = $;</code>
      <br />
      If you have multiple copies of <tt>jQuery</tt> on the page, or simply want
      to tell Backbone to use a particular object as its DOM / Ajax library,
      this is the property for you.
